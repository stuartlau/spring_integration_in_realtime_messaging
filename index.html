					## Realtime Submission Messaging Brief
					* Message consuming, e.g. from AWS Kinesis
					* Different logic for different markdown actions, e.g. CREATE, UPDATE, RETRACT
					* Filtering, e.g. unsupported Realm, invalid data
					* Multi-Threading, lots of Producer&Consumer scenarios
					* Dependent on other services getting required data based on different data type, e.g. SDVP data, config data
					* Logics to compute core business values, e.g. Duration, Qty
					* A classic messaging process, consuming data -> validity checking -> filter out invalid -> splitting -> routing to different handlers -> different execution -> publishing

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Old Design with Self-Implemented Framework
					* All the logics such as blocking queues(e.g. *ArrayListBlockingQueue*), multiple threading(e.g. *ExecutorService*), pub-sub are self-implemented, wasting time in writing non-business UTs, e.g. queue functions
					* All the input collection logics using *Chain Strategy*, not easy to get a quick view and painful to change structure
					* Filter logic resides in the heart of business logic, not SRP
					* Some logics are roughly coupled or don't know where exactly it should be, e.g. Splitting resides with message receiving logic
					* Exception handling is everywhere and hard to extract as extensible component
					* Temp values newed everywhere, not clean code
					* Logging is heavily coupled with business handlers
					* Add new code when data is desired by other component 
					* High maintenance
					* Boundary between components is vague

					## Spring Integration Introduction
					> Spring Integration's primary goal is to provide a simple model for building enterprise integration solutions while maintaining the separation of concerns that is essential for producing maintainable, testable code.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Brief
					* Enables lightweight messaging within Spring-based applications
					* Supports integration with external systems via declarative adapters(File, FTP, JMS, TCP, HTTP, JDBC, etc)
					* Provides a higher-level of abstraction over Spring's support for remoting, messaging, and scheduling

					Spring Integration is motivated by the following goals: 

					* Provide a simple model for implementing complex enterprise integration solutions
					* Facilitate asynchronous, message-driven behavior within a Spring-based application
					* Promote intuitive, incremental adoption for existing Spring users

					Spring Integration is guided by the following principles: 

					* Components should be loosely coupled for modularity and testability
					* The framework should enforce separation of concerns between business logic and integration logic
					* Extension points should be abstract in nature but within well-defined boundaries to promote reuse and portability

					### Basic Component
					* Message
					* Channel
					* Filter
					* Splitter
					* Router
					* Transformer
					* Activator
					* Chain
					* Gateway
